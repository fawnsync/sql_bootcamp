EX00
Please write an SQL statement that returns the total volume (sum of all money) of transactions from the user balance aggregated by user and balance type. Note that all data should be processed, including data with anomalies. Below is a table of result columns and the corresponding calculation formula.

EX01
Please write an SQL statement that returns all Users, all Balance transactions (in this task please ignore Currencies that do not have a key in the Currency table) with currency name and calculated value of the currency in USD for the next day.

EX02 
Please create a table with named nodes using structure {point1, point2, cost} and fill data based on a picture (remember there are direct and reverse paths between 2 nodes).
Please write a SQL statement that returns all tours (aka paths) with minimum travel cost if we start from city "a".
Remember, you need to find the cheapest way to visit all cities and return to your starting point. For example, the tour looks like a -> b -> c -> d -> a.

EX03
Please add a way to see additional rows with the most expensive cost to the SQL from the previous exercise. Take a look at the sample data below. Please sort the data by total_cost and then by trip.
